# Session Time (WoW Addon)
Shows the current session's time played and provides stats regarding play time.

## Features:
- Current session's time.
- Minimap button to show/hide the main addon's frame.
- Sessions history (date and hour, time played, character).
- Play time stats.
- Last two points can display user data (default) or character-specific data.
- For sessions time (current and history), color is interpolated using time:
  - 0 seconds → Green 
  - 1 hour → Yellow
  - 2 hours → Red
- For stats time, color is interpolated using time:
  - 0 seconds → Green
  - 2 hours → Yellow
  - 3 hours → Red
- Being *Away*/*AFK* stops the session's time counter.
- **[NEW]** All sessions' data can be obtained in CSV format.
